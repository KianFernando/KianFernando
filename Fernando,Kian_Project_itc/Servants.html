  <h3 style="text-align:center;">Servant Classes</h3>
  <p>
Servants are Heroic Spirits that you, as the Master, command in Battle. Each Servant has a Class, active skills, passive skills, and Noble Phantasm. They are also grouped into 3 types the Knight classes (Saber, Archer and Lancer), Cavalry classes (Rider, Caster, Assassin and Berserker) and Extra classes (Ruler, Avenger, Moon Cancer, Shielder, Alter Ego and Foreigner).

Servants are primarily obtained via summoning. 3★ Servants or below may be summoned for 200 Friend Points each, and 3-5★ servants for 3 Saint Quartz each. Some Servants can be obtained as special rewards during events.

You can Ascend Servants to increase their maximum level, slightly changing their art and battle sprites. Ascending can also unlock new skills, all of which can be reinforced. Their Noble Phantasms can also be upgraded; combining the same Servant upgrades the NP level, while completing Interludes may upgrade the rank.

There are currently 280 Servants, of which 114 are limited or unplayable (As of May 2020), either because they were only obtainable as event rewards, they have not been added to the general summoning pool yet, or they are only available for limited times.

    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Saber</h3>
    <p>Servants placed within this class are agile and powerful melee warriors adept at swordsmanship, boasting high ratings in all categories, and they are often heroes from the Age of Gods when magecraft was still commonplace. The qualifying conditions require the Heroic Spirits to have legends as knights of the sword, and it is the class that requires the highest levels of attributes in all but the Magic attribute. It is possible for the status qualifications to be bypassed in special circumstances, such as through Nero Claudius Caesar's Imperial Privilege. Toyotomi Hideyoshi's Noble Phantasm Sword Hunt qualifies him as an extremely rare Saber without qualities distinctive of the class. Compatible Heroic Spirits usually excel in delivering powerful burst attacks.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Archer</h3>
    <p>Archer Knight of the Bow and Heroic Spirit of the Bow, is one of the Three Knight Classes among the seven standard Servant classes summoned for the Holy Grail War. Servants placed within this Class excel in possessing powerful Noble Phantasms, are able to act as highly effective scouts, and are frequently Heroic Spirits from the Age of Gods when magecraft was still commonplace. The qualifying condition for the Heroic Spirits is not attributes, but instead the possession of powerful projectile weapons or special abilities related to projectile weapons. They possess high Magic Resistance as a Class Skill, so most modern magi are unable to inflict damage to them. They also possess Independent Action, allowing them the ability to act independently for a length of time without an active supply of magical energy from their Master.
Due to excelling in powerful Noble Phantasms, Tokiomi Tohsaka considers it inevitable that Gilgamesh, with his EX ranked Ea, came to be of this class. For Archers with high ranked Independent Action and a disposition opposite to the Master, the only guaranteed way to control them is through the use of Command Spells.[2] Servants will generally assume that the Noble Phantasm of an Archer-class Servant is their bow, but any projectile weapons, even firearms, can be indicative of an Archer.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Lancer</h3>
    <p>Lancer Knight of the Lance and Heroic Spirit of the Lance, is one of the Three Knight Classes among the seven standard Servant classes summoned for the Holy Grail War. Servants placed within this class, many of which are Heroic Spirits who were knights, are very agile, display excellent close combat skills, show proficiency in hit-and-run tactics that capitalize on range and speed, and are skilled with long-range melee weapons such as spears and lances. The qualifying conditions to be placed within the class are second only to the Saber class, requiring overall excellent attributes and a high agility attribute. Their only particular class ability is Magic Resistance, and although they "tend to be less flashy than the other classes", they display great reliability.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Rider</h3>
    <p> Rider Mounted Knight and Heroic Spirit of the Mount, is one of the Four Cavalry Classes among the seven standard Servant classes summoned for the Holy Grail War. Servants placed within this Class are those known for riding mounts, whether living beasts or human constructs, during their lives. There are even some cases where legendary animals have been summoned as a Servant such as Vánagandr and Red Hare. They generally have lower attributes compared to the Three Knight Classes, but the abilities of the mounts described in their legends compensate by granting them powerful Noble Phantasms or abilities. They have the class abilities of Magic Resistance and a high rank in Riding, allowing them to fully utilize the abilities of their mounts. Depending on the rank, they can take full control of everything from simple horses, modern machinery like motorcycles and planes, and even Divine Beasts. Dragons are the only exception as the ability to ride them falls under a different Skill; however, rare exceptions do occur.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Assassin</h3>
    <p>Assassin Silent Killer and Heroic Spirit of Assassination, is one of the Four Cavalry Classes among the seven standard Servant classes summoned for the Holy Grail War. Within certain Holy Grail War structures, the only qualifying Heroic Spirits are the nineteen Hassan-i-Sabbah due to the etymology of the very word Assassin being tied to them. Within the Fuyuki Holy Grail War, is said to be fixed in the system itself that Hassan will always be summoned, but there is a small chance, so low as to be considered nonexistent, that another will answer the summons. The existence of Sasaki Kojiro is an abberation within that system due to his unique circumstances. Within the world of Fate/Apocrypha, the Subcategory Holy Grail War led to a proliferation in the number of Hassans summoned, allowing all of their True Names and Noble Phantasms to be documented. Masters eventually began adding additional lines to the summoning incantations and bringing catalysts not associated with Hassan to call upon different Heroic Spirits.

    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Caster</h3>
    <p>Caster Magus and Heroic Spirit of Spells and Sorcery, is one of the Four Cavalry Classes among the seven standard Servant classes summoned for the Holy Grail War. Servants placed within this Class are usually adept in magecraft, and the only qualifying condition is the mastery of sorceries of the highest caliber compared to the specific parameter requirements of the other classes. Due to not requiring any strong statistics, they generally have low combat abilities, and due to the majority of Servants having some form of Magic Resistance, this Class is thought to be the weakest of all seven. They make up for this with other means, using magecraft that no longer exists in the current age and, no matter which Heroic Spirit is of which Class, possessing many possible ploys to be used against enemies. Those of the Saber Class can likely challenge any Caster who uses magecraft as their main offensive ability without needing to plan due to their high Magic Resistance, while those of lesser resistance like the Rider Class may require more strategy. Their class abilities are Territory Creation, altering the surrounding lands in favor of their sorcery, and Item Construction, which allows the magus to create magical items and tools.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Berserker</h3>
    <p>Berserker, Mad Warrior and Heroic Spirit of Berserk Rage, is one of the Four Cavalry Classes among the seven standard Servant classes summoned for the Holy Grail War. Servants placed within this Class are always Heroic Spirits who have gone berserk during battle at least once in their lifetime. This trait allows them to use the special ability Mad Enhancement, which trades their consciousness and sanity for a large power boost. This Class is usually for magi who have summoned Heroic Spirits with insufficient abilities and attributes, allowing them to strengthen their Servants to make up for their lower attributes and compete against stronger opponents. While it is ideal for Servants to reach the level of the Heroic Spirit, the Class allows for their attributes to surpass even the original. If used on an already strong Heroic Spirit, such as Heracles, they will become empowered to truly extraordinary levels. The abuse of this to create powerful Servants has made the Class referred to as the strongest of all seven classes.
It is possible to specify in the summoning ritual that the Servant be placed under the Berserker Class for those familiar with the workings of the Grail System. By adding in a specific line, Zouken Matou and the Einzbern family, as members of the Three Founding Families, were able to choose the Class during the Fourth and Fifth Holy Grail Wars respectively. This Class comes at a price, as the Berserker Class is the most difficult to control and a Master must expend a large amount of additional magical energy merely to maintain the Berserker, and the affected Heroic Spirit may lose access to certain abilities or even Noble Phantasms depending on how much sanity it has taken away for power.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Ruler</h3>
    <p>Ruler, Heroic Spirit of Arbitration, is a non-standard Servant Class brought forth for the purpose of presiding over Holy Grail Wars. The Fuyuki Grail utilizes its own logic to sense when actions are encroaching upon its authority, and regardless of other mediators like those from the Church, it brings forth Ruler to protect the concept of the Holy Grail War itself. In the case of the reserve system of the Greater Grail being activated in the Great Holy Grail War, Ruler takes neither side of the battle, but only acts in the interest of the Grail. The Ruler-class Servants are given Command Spells for the other Servants.
A Ruler is also summoned to preserve the laws of Heroic Spirits to ensure they won't be violated, such as the law of "the dead not leading the living", touted as the greatest law of Heroic Spirits, and to maintain human history by preserving the illusion behind the Age of Gods so that people do not know about the truth behind it. The role of a Ruler is to arbitrate the truth and adjudicate all things in order to maintain human history.

The criteria to be summoned for the Ruler Class is impartiality and possessing no desire for the Holy Grail. Those who qualify are most often Saints, and any Ruler summoned to preside over a Holy Grail will be a Saint under normal conditions. Within other systems like the FATE System, others who meet the criteria can be summoned. One exception to the normal rule of impartiality is Amakusa Shirou Tokisada, an aberration who does not normally qualify, summoned by the Einzberns as the Heroic Spirit who was considered the closest to a ‘Saint’ that could possibly be found in the Far East.

    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Avenger</h3>
    <p>Avenger, Heroic Spirit of Vengeance,Avenger is a class founded on vengeance, born from powerful resentment that does not fade even after death. Rather than revenge, the primary characteristic behind them is avenging. Angra Mainyu says there are two types of Avengers. Those who "scorn love" like Angra Mainyu are described with "Those born from hatred speak of love... and they would show compassion after experiencing cruelty." Those who "burn with pure hatred" like Dantes are described with "Those born from love speak of hatred. Those who experienced happiness meet their end through betrayal." The common point between the two types is an attachment to humans. Being fixated on humans causes them to be unable to evolve beyond humans, so Angra Mainyu describes their hatred as "an endless cycle of what goes around comes around."

Angra Mainyu states that he lacks any particular grudges against others, but many have grudges against him.For Gorgon, she's uncertain of why she is an Avenger, feeling desire for revenge burning within her Saint Graph, but unable to tell what she hates. She feels the need to kill and devour all living things due to the infuriating thoughts stemming from that unknown target of hatred. Upon seeing her other self in a dream, she wonders if it's telling her to seek revenge against humans and the very world that led to her downfall.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Alter Ego</h3>
    <p>Alter Ego , an existence taken out of or separated from a certain Spirit Origin and altered, is a non-standard Extra Servant Class comprised of beings that are split off from another. Differing from Alter Servants that are an alternate side or interpretation of a Heroic Spirit, Alter Egos are a phenomenon where "one persona of that Heroic Spirit gains independence as a separate entity"; essentially, they are personifications of the original being's emotions, wishes, or personality traits. Artoria Pendragon is the same person as Artoria Pendragon Alter, while BB and Passionlip are unique individuals.
The term Alter Ego is not limited to a Servant class, but also the Servant's very state of being. It's possible for an Alter Ego to be of another Servant class while still being an Alter Ego. Both the Sakura Five and the Tamamo Nine are comprised of Alter Egos.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Foreiner</h3>
    <p> Foreigner, Visitor from the Empty Void,Chaldea Security Organization has a limited understanding of the class, but defines it as a class for "beings who overturn the base laws of our world." They are said to be individuals who have "descended from superstition," those who have kept their "purity in the heart of madness" or who are "swallowed by madness but then turn around and consume the madness in turn.” Typically not Heroic Spirits, Foreigners are similar enough in nature to be classified in that way for the purposes of Chaldea. As foreign beings from outside of the world, they are typically bonded with an Outer God, the process of creating one being known as a complex process with a low chance of success. For Abigail Williams and Katsushika Hokusai, the plan of Demon God Raum was necessary to create the conditions under which the Outer Gods could come into contact with their hosts.

The class can be attributed to those without a connection to an Outer God, such as Voyager when summoned under the conditions of the Fate/Grand Order world.</p>

    <p> MoonCancer, the Irregular who threatens the world of the moon, The key figures on the two versions of the tarot card for the class are BB and Kiara Sessyoin. Kiara says that both of them "scarred the moon" during the Moon Holy Grail War, and Kiara says her personal qualifications must be due to the happenings in the War. She describes it as a very rare Servant class. In the case of Jinako Carigiri, she speculates her being in the class has to do with the "little devil intermediary" helping link Ganesha to her in the Pseudo-Servant summoning process</p>
